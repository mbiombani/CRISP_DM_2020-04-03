    Context
From World Health Organization - On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, we do not know how it affects people.

So daily level information on the affected people can give some interesting insights when it is made available to the broader data science community.

Johns Hopkins University has made an excellent dashboard using the affected cases data. Data is extracted from the google sheets associated and made available here.


Content
2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people - CDC

This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus. Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number.

The data is available from 22 Jan, 2020.

Column Description
Main file in this dataset is covid19data.csv and the detailed descriptions are below.

covid19data.csv

Sno - Serial number
ObservationDate - Date of the observation in MM/DD/YYYY
Province/State - Province or state of the observation (Could be empty when missing)
Country/Region - Country of observation
Last Update - Time in UTC at which the row is updated for the given province or country. (Not standardised)
Confirmed - Cumulative number of confirmed cases till that date
Deaths - Cumulative number of of deaths till that date
Recovered - Cumulative number of recovered cases till that date
Apart from that these two files have individual level information

Inspiration
Some useful insights that could be extracted from the dataset can be:

The origin of the individuals who were in Wuhan before the outbreak (first confirmed case).
Were men or women the most exposed?
What are the headlines in the newspapers and what are the different sources?
The most observed symptoms?
    \section{A Look at the Data}\label{a-look-at-the-data}

In order to get a better understanding of the data we will be looking at
throughout, let's take a look at some of the characteristics of the
dataset.

First, let's read in the data and necessary libraries.
